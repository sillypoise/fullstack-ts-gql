# Fullstack TypeScript + GraphQL

Creating a demo app to test fullstack TypeScript in conjuction with GraphQL.

This is an educational project whose focus is on testing how to implement a GraphQL api with fullstack typesafety.

The project is also structured as a monorepo to test how to share packages between frontend and backend code.

Feel free to poke around and ask questions :)
